Poor mans backlogs integration tester for ubuntu precise 64bit

Basic host preparation:
1. execute install-pre.sh to install environmental basics and the test environment template on the host system

Setup:
2. run generate.sh to generate tests from travis matrix.

Testing:
3. edit generated-tests.sh to suite the needs and run it with 'sudo bash generated-tests.sh'. It will fork of all tests in parallel, so better have ram and cpus. To stop the tests, wait an hour or reboot the host.
When the test session is running, type <ctrl>-a " to get a list of session windows to choose from.

Watch the logfiles and put the system load on youtube :-)
